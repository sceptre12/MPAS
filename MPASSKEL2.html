				The FIU Minority Opportunities in Research (MORE) Program began in 1985 and has grown to include the MBRS RISE, MBRS SCORE and MARC U*STAR Programs. The FIU SCORE Program assists FIU faculty in the preparation of grant proposals and provides administrative support post-award. The RISE Program also promotes the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in research by providing salaries for the students, tuition for graduate students, and travel funds for the students to attend scientific meetings. In a similar fashion, the MARC U*STAR Program focuses on Junior and Senior undergraduate students. The students are involved in original research and, depending on their level, are expected to present their work at professional meetings and publish their results in research journals. The FIU MORE Program also enriches FIU by bringing prominent guest speakers to campus to meet with students, cosponsoring an annual symposium and providing a clearing house for students to learn about special training programs and career opportunities in biomedical research, such as NIH internships.

				FIU offers, through a variety of academic programs, advanced study and research in the biomedical area at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. The Departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, Physics, Computer &amp; Information Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, Mechanical &amp; Materials Engineering, Dietetics &amp; Nutrition, Environmental Studies and Psychology all offer B.A., B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. programs, and there are also opportunities in the FIU College of Medicine and in the Robert Stempel College of Public Health &amp; Social Work.

				So whether you are a faculty member interested in learning about NIH/NIGMS funding opportunities or a student interested in a career in biomedical research, chances are the FIU MORE Program has something for you!
