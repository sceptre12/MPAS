The Tester fles are to be copied and stored on your own computer. any changes you make do it in them and then ask around to see if anyone has recently pushed a change.
If no one has pushed a change, copy whatever changes you've made out of these tester files, paste them in the tester files on your own desktop, then type in "git stash"(1)
after type in "git pull origin master" (2) after which you will have the newest changes... Check to make sure everything is in order after which, copy your changes into the appropriate feilds. 
Then type in "git stash clear"(3). After that then type in "git add ."(4) "git commit -m "[description of of what changes you've done]"" (5) then "git push origin master"

REFERENCE SECTION 
1 - (Saftey method.. it basically pushes what you have in your directory onto a stack this is just a fail safe just incase you accidentally end up overiding any new changes you've made)
2 - (We'll be working with the master branch till the php section of things is needed. The php branch is called NewBranch whoever wants to start transfering code into php please do so but try to help finish out the skeleton of the website first)
3 - empties the stash meaning it will delete the last stack you pushed to it 
4 - Adds the new changes 
5- Just so everyone is on the same page and can understand what changes you've done..  just give a general overview
